Kafka Replication and Fault Tolerance

Replication Factor:
The replication factor determines how many copies of each partition are maintained across the Kafka cluster. A replication factor of 3 means each partition has one leader and two follower replicas.

Setting Replication Factor:
When creating a topic, specify the replication factor:

kafka-topics.sh --create --topic my-replicated-topic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --replication-factor 3

Best Practices:
- Use a replication factor of at least 3 for production environments
- Replication factor cannot exceed the number of brokers in the cluster
- Higher replication factors provide better fault tolerance but use more disk space

Leader and Followers:
- Each partition has one leader replica that handles all reads and writes
- Follower replicas passively replicate the leader's data
- If the leader fails, one follower is automatically elected as the new leader

In-Sync Replicas (ISR):
- ISR is the set of replicas that are fully caught up with the leader
- Only in-sync replicas can be elected as leaders
- Configure min.insync.replicas to ensure data durability
